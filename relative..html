        Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior is a 2020 Indian historical action film directed by Om Raut. The movie stars Ajay Devgn as Tanhaji Malusare, a Maratha warrior, and is set during the 17th century when the Maratha Empire was in its prime under the leadership of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

The film is based on the real-life hero Tanhaji Malusare, who is known for his bravery during the Battle of Sinhagad, where he successfully captured the Kondhana fort from the Mughal forces. The movie explores Tanhaji's loyalty, courage, and sacrifice for his empire and his king, Shivaji Maharaj (played by Sharad Kelkar).

        Key Filming Locations:
Maharashtra:

Many sequences were filmed in and around real forts in Maharashtra, such as the Sinhagad Fort, where the actual battle for Kondhana took place. However, due to the difficulty in filming at such high altitudes, the filmmakers also recreated the fort on large sets.

        Rajasthan:

Some parts of the movie, particularly the scenes set in the Mughal Empire, were filmed in Rajasthan, which is known for its historical architecture and royal palaces. These locations helped replicate the grandeur and scale of the Mughal period.

        VFX & Set Design: Since the film was set in a time with no existing visuals, extensive use of visual effects was made to create realistic battle sequences, fort landscapes, and larger-than-life settings. The sets were meticulously designed to resemble the 17th-century period, with careful attention to detail regarding architecture, costumes, and props.

Action Sequences: The filmmakers invested heavily in choreographing grand action scenes, particularly the battle sequences. For instance, the famous Sinhagad Fort battle required a lot of preparation and was a crucial part of the film. The stunts were a combination of real-action sequences and visual effects.
