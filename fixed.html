        Pavan Khind is a 2021 Marathi-language historical drama film directed by Digpal Lanjekar. The movie tells the story of the legendary Pavan Khind (meaning "Holy Pass"), a famous battle in Maratha history, where a small group of Maratha soldiers, led by Baji Prabhu Deshpande, held off a much larger Mughal army to allow Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his forces to escape from the Mughals after the fall of Panhala Fort.

        Plot Overview:
The story revolves around the Battle of Pavan Khind (also known as the Battle of Ghod Khind), which took place in 1660. The Maratha forces, led by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, had to flee from Panhala Fort to escape the advancing Mughal army. To ensure their safe passage, Baji Prabhu Deshpande was tasked with holding off the Mughal forces at the narrow pass of Pavan Khind with a small contingent of soldiers.

        One of the major challenges of the film was to recreate the narrow, rugged terrain of Pavan Khind, where the actual battle took place. The filmmakers sought to shoot in Pavan Khind, which is located near Ghod Khind in the Sahyadri mountain range, Maharashtra. This pass is known for its steep terrain and narrow roads, providing the ideal backdrop for the intense battle scene.
Panhala Fort also plays a key role in the film. Some portions of the movie were filmed at or near historical locations, as the filmmakers wanted to maintain authenticity in depicting the Maratha strongholds.

        While much of the film relied on real locations, several battle scenes, especially the close-quarter fighting scenes, were shot on specially constructed sets. The filmmakers built a large-scale set to represent the Ghod Khind Pass, where the Maratha warriors fought valiantly against the Mughals. The set was designed to look like the natural terrain of the region, with steep inclines, rocky surfaces, and dense vegetation to simulate the difficult terrain of the original battleground.
To achieve a realistic feel, large portions of the battle scenes were filmed using practical effects, with many stunts performed live on location, allowing the actors to experience the hardships of the terrain and providing a raw, authentic look.

        The film also utilized other scenic and rugged locations in Maharashtra to represent the historical setting of the Maratha Empire. The natural landscapes helped create a backdrop that enhanced the film’s authenticity and made the battle scenes more immersive.
Sahyadri Hills and nearby locations were used for capturing the essence of the topography where Baji Prabhu and his soldiers made their stand. These areas helped convey the tactical importance of the battle location.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the key aspects of the shooting was the preparation for the battle sequences. Given the nature of the film, with many action-packed scenes involving sword fights, hand-to-hand combat, and large-scale skirmishes, the filmmakers employed choreographers and stunt coordinators to carefully plan out the sequences. The film's cinematography ensured that these high-intensity scenes were shot in a way that depicted the close, intense nature of the fight.
The tight geography of the narrow pass, combined with a small group of soldiers holding off a much larger force, was important to depict accurately, and much care was taken to shoot the sequences to reflect the overwhelming odds faced by the Maratha warriors.
